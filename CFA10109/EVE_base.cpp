//
// Low-Level routines for EVE accelerators.
//
// This is a simplified / refactored version of the code in FTDI's AN_275:
//
//  http://brtchip.com/wp-content/uploads/Support/Documentation/Application_Notes/ICs/EVE/AN_275_FT800_Example_with_Arduino.pdf
//
// I have added support for the EVE series.
//
// The write offset into the write buffer is passed into and back from
// functions rather than being a global.
//
// In the spirit of AN_275:
//
//   An “abstraction layer” concept was explicitly avoided in this
//   example. Rather, direct use of the Arduino libraries demonstrates
//   the simplicity of sending and receiving data through the FT800
//   while producing a graphic output.
//
// My main goal here is to be transparent about what is really happening
// from the high to lowest levels, without obfuscation, while still
// at least giving a nod to good programming practices.
//
// Plus, you probably don't have RAM and flash for all those fancy
// programming layers.
